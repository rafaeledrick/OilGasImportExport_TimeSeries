**Movement of Oil and Gas and Non-Oil and Gas Import Export Values in Indonesia: A Time Series Analysis**

A Time Series Analysis project using six time series methods, which are the Naive, Double Moving Average, Double Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, Neural Network, and the Time Series Regression model to analyze the trends and patterns in the export-import values of oil and gas and non-oil and gas commodities in Indonesia from 1975 to 2023.

Based on the results obtained, several recommendations can be made for future research to enhance the performance of forecasting models. Firstly, further optimization and tuning of the Neural Network model could enhance its performance. Techniques such as cross-validation, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning should be explored. Secondly, investigating hybrid models that combine the strengths of different forecasting.
